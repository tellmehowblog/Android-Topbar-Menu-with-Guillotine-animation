Have you ever wondered why a sidebar in apps has to be a “side” bar? Why not to make it a “topbar,” or a “bottombar,” or a “cornerbar,” etc.?
A new animated trend in the generation of navigation bars is what we are going to talk about this time. Animations are fun but most importantly, they are useful. They can change your way of thinking, make your product catchy, and improve user experience.

When I started thinking about what to create this time, I caught myself on a thought that a typical sidebar menu which sadly gets out of the left part of the screen moving all content to the right, is so unbearably boring! What if a sidebar becomes a topbar?

It’s going to drop down from the top of the page and turn in a unique way. Sounds like fun, doesn’t it?”
